# Server

This is the README file for the Server component, which is built with Node.js and utilizes Express for handling HTTP requests. The Server component provides validation, authorization/authentication functionalities, and utilizes libraries such as JWT, Bcrypt, and Validator.

## Technologies Used

The Server component is developed using the following technologies and libraries:

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side and networking applications.
- Express: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
- Bcrypt: A library for hashing and salting passwords to enhance security.
- Validator: A library for validating and sanitizing input data.

## Features

The Server component includes the following features:

1. Validation: Utilizes the Validator library to validate and sanitize incoming data, ensuring its integrity and consistency.
2. Authorization/Authentication: Implements JWT for secure user authentication and authorization.
3. Password Hashing: Uses Bcrypt to securely hash and salt passwords, enhancing password storage security.
